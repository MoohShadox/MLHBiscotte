# MyOctocat Challenge

For the __2019 Major League Hack, Local Hack Day__, __GitHub__ organized a side challenge for the hackathon that consists on creating a version of Octocat, GitHub's mascotte based on the LHD participants own vision, and share it on twitter on both __@GitHubEducation__ and __@MLHacks__ with the hashtags __#MyOctocat__ __and #LocalHackDay__ in an attempt to win a figurineto the image of the participant creation.
For this challenge and as part of team "Biscottes" i made a 3D model of octocat based on Spirited Away Kaonashi (No-Face) spirit, i call it __Kaonashi Takoneko__ *(No-Face Octocat)*.
